# General installation 


## Requirements:

- A linux based system with python 3 or later available. Debian and Red-hat based systems are recommended, others (Arch-based for example) may work but are currently not tested.
- A database for PowerDNS-Admin, if you are using a database for PowerDNS itself this must be separate to that database.
